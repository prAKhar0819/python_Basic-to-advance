# Day 1 - What is Programming and Python?

## What is Programming?

Programming is a way for us to tell computers what to do. A computer is a very dumb machine and it only does what we tell it to do. Hence, we learn programming and tell computers to do what we are very slow at – computation.

If I ask you to calculate `5 + 6`, you will immediately say `11`. How about `23453453 × 56456`?

You will start searching for a calculator or jump to a new tab to calculate the same.

This **100 Days of Code** series will help you learn Python from the beginning to the end. We will start from 0, and by the time we end this course, I promise you will be a **job-ready Python developer**!

## What is Python?

Python is a **dynamically typed**, general-purpose programming language that supports an **object-oriented** programming approach as well as a **functional** programming approach.

- Python is an **interpreted** and **high-level** programming language.
- It was created by **Guido Van Rossum** in 1989.

## Features of Python

- Python is **simple and easy to understand**.
- It is **interpreted** and **platform-independent**, which makes debugging very easy.
- Python is an **open-source** programming language.
- Python provides **very big library support**. Some of the popular libraries include:
  - NumPy
  - TensorFlow
  - Selenium
  - OpenCV
- It is possible to **integrate other programming languages** within Python.

## What is Python used for?

- **Data Visualization**: Create plots and graphical representations.
- **Data Analytics**: Analyze and understand raw data for insights and trends.
- **AI and Machine Learning**: Simulate human behavior and learn from past data without hard coding.
- **Web Development**: Create web applications.
- **Database Handling**: Work with and manage databases.
- **Business and Accounting**: Perform complex mathematical operations and quantitative/qualitative analysis.

## Why Replit?

- Replit is **very easy to share tutorials and code**.
- You can easily **fork** this Repl and continue learning in your own style.
- **Video, code, and text tutorials** on the same page make things easy!

> For fellow teachers out there:  
> You can create a `.tutorial` folder to create tutorials using Replit.
